### Changes
- Vats no longer produce fruity fluid. Instead, you may click on them directly with an empty jar with lid to get jam. Proper rendering for this is TBD.
- Chimneys are now a completely solid block.
- Fruity fluid is now called "UNUSED" as it is not used anymore.
- Increased the default time for non-oven recipes in the oven to 1 in-game hour. This effectively means that it will take extra time to 'burn' bread and meat.
- Made items that have the 'Oven Baked' trait heat slightly slower in the oven.
- Updated the jade display for ovens.
- Recipe changes from the last update didn't get added for some reason, so these are included now. Enjoy.
